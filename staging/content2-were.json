The sixth angel, for instance, is depicted pouring out his vial upon the great river Euphrates, causing its water to dry up. This action is part of the \"tremendous climax between good and evil\" and precedes the second coming of Christ. The releasing of four angels at the Euphrates is also mentioned in the sixth trumpet, where they gather an army to kill one-third of mankind. The \"kings from the sunrising,\" who represent Christ and the armies of heaven, have their way prepared by the drying of the Euphrates, signifying the removal of support from spiritual Babylon. This entire process highlights God's intervention in world events through angelic and heavenly powers."

Just as the literal Euphrates was the \"glory and protection\" of ancient Babylon, ensuring its impregnability and prosperity, the symbolic Euphrates signifies the global human backing that sustains modern Babylon. This support encompasses \"millions of people around the globe\", including nations, rulers, merchants, financiers, and multinational corporations. The drying up of these \"waters\" means that these widespread civil, secular, and political powers will retract their allegiance and eventually turn against Babylon, leading to her downfall. This event also serves to expose Babylon's true character to the world and the universe, ensuring that God's justice is vindicated when Babylon is destroyed."

Revelation 16:12 clearly states, \"The sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates and the water thereof was dried up\". This plague is part of the seven last plagues that fall upon the earth \"after the close of probation and preceding the second coming of Christ\". The sixth plague is symbolically applied, drawing from ancient Babylon, which is always symbolic in Revelation. The seventh plague, by contrast, is characterized by a voice from heaven declaring \"It is done!\", followed by lightning, voices, thunder, a great earthquake, and hail."

Rather, the sources indicate that apostate Protestantism is one of the three main parts comprising \"spiritual Babylon,\" along with the political powers (the dragon) and the Papacy (the beast). \"All the world wondered after the beast,\" signifying that Babylon will gain control of \"all the peoples of the world,\" including all who are \"not faithful to Christ\". These millions of people, nations, rulers, merchants, financiers, and multinationals constitute Babylon's support, symbolized by the Euphrates. The \"drying up\" occurs when these very supporters, after witnessing natural upheavals and the futility of Babylon's help, turn against her. This dramatic reversal happens as God exposes Babylon, leading to her desolation and destruction by those who once supported her."

The sixth plague, where the Euphrates is dried up, directly contributes to Babylon's downfall. The plagues are intended to \"punish Babylon\" and, crucially, to \"expose her\". Babylon, described as the \"great whore\" and \"great city\", is targeted by these plagues. The exposure of Babylon's true character is essential to ensure universal assent to God's actions when Christ ultimately destroys Babylon and her supporters. The fifth plague, bringing darkness upon Babylon's seat of authority, further highlights the futility of seeking help from Babylon, leading her supporters to turn against her."

Revelation prophesies that \"in the last days, Babylon is to dominate the world\". This is further emphasized by statements that \"the world at large will support Babylon\" and that she will \"sit as queen of the nations, just as did ancient Babylon\". \"All the world wondered after the beast,\" indicating that Babylon will gain control of \"all the peoples of the world\". The support of these \"multitudes of people around the globe\" is what makes modern Babylon's position seemingly impregnable, much like the literal Euphrates protected ancient Babylon. It is only after Babylon has attained this universal dominion and revealed her true character that God permits events like the drying up of her symbolic support to occur."

Ancient Babylon was physically situated on the Euphrates River, which served as its \"glory and protection\" and was essential for its survival, irrigation, and defense. The prophecies of Jeremiah and Isaiah foretold ancient Babylon's destruction through the drying up of her waters. This was literally fulfilled by King Cyrus and his Medes and Persians, who diverted the Euphrates river, allowing their army to enter the city through the riverbed during a night of revelry. In Revelation, this historical event serves as a \"type or picture\" for modern Babylon, where the symbolic waters (her global supporters) are \"dried up,\" or turned away, from her."

These individuals, who were once deluded or \"intoxicated by Babylon's doctrine or philosophy\" and manipulated to \"attack God's people\", will experience a profound reversal. This dramatic shift is brought about by God's intervention, particularly during the fifth plague of darkness. When confronted with shattering evidence that God's remnant is protected, and realizing they have been deceived and robbed of eternal life by their leaders, the multitudes react with \"bitter hate\" and \"frightful violence\". They accuse their ministers of failing to warn them and misleading them, even turning the very hands that once praised them to their destruction. This is described as the \"removal of the support of the peoples all over the world from the great apostate religious system\"."

This warning serves as a direct message from Jesus Christ and is likely intended for the \"last generation,\" urging vigilance and faithfulness amidst the unfolding end-time events.

A \"dense blackness\" falls upon the earth, followed by a \"rainbow, shining with the glory from the throne of God,\" which \"encircles each praying company\". This astonishing display shocks Babylon's supporters into the realization that \"these despised, hated and peculiar people are the chosen of God\".

This approach views the various sections of the Apocalypse—the seals, trumpets, and bowls—as parallel rather than strictly sequential. The thematic unity found in the tripartite structure of the sixth seal, sixth trumpet, and sixth bowl argues that they depict the same \"activity\" (preparation for final judgment or the witness of Christians) but from different perspectives, implying a parallel, not sequential, unfolding of events. This interpretive method helps resolve disagreements among exegetes about the book's structure and meaning."

Furthermore, Ezekiel 13:22 is quoted: \"With lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life\".

This confession occurs after their eyes are opened and they realize the \"awful fruitage of their ministry\".

The source draws a parallel to Israel's history, noting that God's anger at Israel's idolatry led to their being \"handed over\" to plunderers and enemies. In the Book of Judges, God's judgment involved allowing His people to experience the consequences of their sin, or actively disciplining them, to call them back to Himself.

However, the primary sources on Revelation emphasize that the Euphrates in prophecy is a symbolic river. The view that it represents a literal country or religion has been \"discarded\" as lacking sound scriptural support. Therefore, while there might be scientific discussions about the literal Euphrates drying up due to climate change and poor watershed management, the prophetic interpretation within the sources explicitly states that the drying up of the Euphrates in Revelation is symbolic of the withdrawal of human support from \"modern Babylon\". Thus, scientific \"proof\" of the literal river drying up would not directly fulfill the prophetic meaning in Revelation according to these sources."

This period serves as a crucial test and exposure, revealing the true character of Babylon and her deceptions. It is also a test for God's faithful, as their endurance and reliance on divine protection are highlighted. The entire sequence of events, from Babylon's global dominion to her ultimate destruction, is a process where God permits Satan to set up his kingdom and allows Babylon to reveal her true character, ensuring that God's justice is unquestionable when He intervenes."
