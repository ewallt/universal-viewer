The aim is not moral improvement but actual transformation of being, like turning a horse into a winged creature rather than teaching it to jump higher. Legal forgiveness is only the beginning; the goal is nothing less than sharing in the divine nature itself. We are not merely pardoned criminals but adopted children, called to inherit everything the Father has. This is the staggering audacity of the Christian claim—that mortal flesh can house immortal life.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>See Mere Christianity, Book IV</i>"

We become bright, stainless mirrors reflecting back to God His own boundless power and delight, though on a smaller scale. This is participation in the uncreated life of the Trinity itself.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>See Mere Christianity, Book IV</i>"

But the likeness of God is something we must grow into, a potential that awaits fulfillment. The image makes us capable of the divine; the likeness makes us actual participants in divinity. We are like photographic plates, designed to receive and develop the divine image, or like mirrors meant to reflect the divine glory. The whole Christian life is the process of that image becoming clearer, that reflection becoming brighter, until we shine with the very light of God Himself."

The command carries within it the power for its own fulfillment, like a sculptor announcing what the marble will become. He who commands is also He who enables, transforming the imperative into promise. Perfect obedience becomes possible not through human effort but through divine transformation. The gap between command and capacity disappears when the Commander becomes the Enabler, reshaping the very nature of those He calls to perfection."

The process is organic rather than mechanical, growing naturally from within rather than imposed from without. Each encounter with the living Christ leaves us a little more like Him, until gradually His character becomes our character, His life our life."

Through bread and wine, through words and silence, through gathering and solitude, the life of God finds its way into the life of man. Each practice becomes a doorway through which grace enters to do its transforming work."

What feels like destruction is actually creation, what seems like wounding is actually healing. The painful blows are not punishment but surgery, not vengeance but artistry. The divine Artist knows exactly which pieces must be chipped away and which must be preserved to reveal the hidden beauty within. Even our resistance becomes material for His skill to transform."
