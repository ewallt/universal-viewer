Every demon cast out, every sick person healed, every dead person raised was a preview of what the cross would accomplish on a cosmic scale. When Jesus said 'I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven,' he wasn't describing a past event—he was announcing a future victory that was so certain it was as good as done. The cross didn't change God's heart toward us; it revealed God's heart by destroying everything that separated us from his love. This is breathtakingly good news: God didn't come to punish us but to liberate us.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>\"For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil\" (1 John 3:8)</i>"

It was a battlefield where Love conquered hate, Life swallowed death, and Light vanquished darkness. Jesus didn't come to pay a debt to the Father—he came to destroy an enemy of the Father. This changes everything about how we understand God's heart toward us. The Father wasn't the one demanding Jesus' death; he was the one grieving it. The Father wasn't extracting vengeance; he was absorbing it. When we see the cross as divine warfare instead of divine child abuse, we discover a God whose love is so fierce that he would rather die than live without us.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>See The Nature of the Atonement: Four Views, pp. 23-49</i>"

Death itself became the instrument of its own destruction when Life entered the tomb. Satan's greatest weapon—the fear of death—was permanently disarmed when Jesus walked out of the grave. This wasn't just a victory; it was the victory that guarantees all other victories. Every subsequent triumph over evil is simply the working out of what was accomplished at Calvary. The powers have been publicly disgraced, their authority revoked, their claims exposed as lies. What remains is simply the cleanup operation.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>\"He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him\" (Colossians 2:15)</i>"

This isn't just about going to heaven when we die; it's about experiencing freedom right now. Every time we choose love over hate, truth over lies, hope over despair, we're living in the reality of Christ's victory. We're not trying to earn God's acceptance—we're celebrating the fact that we already have it, purchased not with money but with the blood of the Lamb."

Instead we start with a man hanging on a cross, arms stretched wide, absorbing the world's hatred and returning it as love. This is God. Not God in disguise, not God playing a role, but God being most himself. The cross doesn't reveal one side of God's character—it reveals the very heart of who God is and how God operates. When we make the cross central to our understanding of God, we discover that divine power looks like vulnerability, divine sovereignty looks like service, and divine justice looks like mercy.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>See The Crucifixion of the Warrior God, Volume 1, pp. 545-597</i>"

This wasn't weakness; it was the ultimate expression of divine strength. When Peter drew his sword to defend Jesus, he was rebuked because he completely misunderstood the nature of God's kingdom. God's power works through love, not force; through sacrifice, not coercion. This is revolutionary: the God who created the universe chooses to rule through self-giving love rather than overwhelming force.

It was when a man died for his enemies, praying for their forgiveness while they killed him. This is what divine power looks like—not the power to destroy opponents but the power to transform them. God doesn't win through might but through love so persistent and patient that it eventually melts the hardest heart. This kind of power can't be resisted forever because it never attacks—it only attracts. It conquers by serving, rules by sacrificing, and triumphs by dying. This is the God we serve: dangerous not because he might hurt us, but because he might love us to death.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>\"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do\" (Luke 23:34)</i>"

But look at Jesus on the cross: he's not being punished by the Father—he's absorbing the punishment that evil inflicts on love. The Father's heart was breaking as he watched his beloved Son suffer, not because he was inflicting the suffering but because love always suffers when it encounters evil. The cross reveals that God would rather absorb evil than inflict it, rather experience injustice than perpetrate it. This God is infinitely safer and more trustworthy than the God who needs violence to satisfy his justice."

At the cross, Jesus looked like a failure, a fraud, a criminal. God allowed himself to be associated with everything ugly and evil so that everything beautiful and good could be redeemed. This wasn't deception—it was the ultimate act of solidarity with a broken world. God stepped so deeply into our darkness that from now on, no one can ever say 'God doesn't understand what I'm going through.' He understands perfectly, and he's been there first.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>\"He made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God\" (2 Corinthians 5:21)</i>"

Like a doctor who risks infection to save patients, Christ risked contamination by evil to heal it from the inside out. But here's the beautiful paradox: perfect love cannot be corrupted by contact with evil; instead, it transforms everything it touches. When holiness meets sin, sin doesn't make holiness dirty—holiness makes sin clean. This is the mystery of the incarnation and the cross: God's love is so pure and powerful that it can enter the deepest darkness without being diminished, only to emerge with captives in its train."

This isn't abandonment—it's tough love. Like a parent who stops enabling a destructive child, God sometimes withdraws his protection to allow the full weight of our choices to be felt. Evil ultimately destroys itself because it's built on lies, hatred, and death—principles that cannot sustain life. God's withdrawal isn't punishment; it's the revelation that life is impossible apart from the source of life.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>See The Crucifixion of the Warrior God, Volume 2, pp. 862-891</i>"

Every empire built on violence eventually crumbles, but the kingdom built on a cross will never end. The resurrection vindicated every choice Jesus made to love instead of fight, to serve instead of dominate, to die instead of kill. It demonstrated that God's 'weakness' is stronger than human strength and God's 'foolishness' is wiser than human wisdom. This is our hope: the same power that raised Jesus from the dead is at work in everyone who trusts in cruciform love.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>\"But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him\" (Acts 2:24)</i>"

These 'literary crucifixes' show us a God so committed to meeting us where we are that he's willing to let us misrepresent him temporarily in order to reveal his true character ultimately.
