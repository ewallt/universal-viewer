When we unite with Christ, we're not just getting forgiveness; we're joining the victory parade. His death becomes our death to everything that enslaved us. His resurrection becomes our resurrection to a completely new kind of life. This isn't metaphorical—it's mystical reality. We actually die to the old self and rise as a new creation. The same power that conquered Satan, sin, and death is now flowing through our veins. We're not just saved from something; we're saved into something magnificent: the very life of God himself.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>\"I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me\" (Galatians 2:20)</i>"

But the cross has exposed every one of these lies. Satan's power over us was built on deception, and deception crumbles when truth is revealed. The truth is that we're so valuable that God would rather die than live without us. The truth is that God has never been angry with us—he's been angry at everything that hurts us. The truth is that no one is beyond hope when infinite love is pursuing them. The truth is that death is a defeated enemy with no ultimate claim on our lives. Step into this truth, and discover what real freedom feels like.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>See Letters from a Skeptic, pp. 45-67</i>"

When Jesus forgives, he doesn't just wipe the slate clean; he rewrites our spiritual DNA. The addiction to selfishness, the compulsion toward destructive behaviors, the inability to trust or love properly—these aren't just moral failures but symptoms of a deeper sickness. The good news is that the Great Physician specializes in terminal cases. He doesn't just declare us healthy; he actually makes us healthy. Every day we can experience more freedom, more wholeness, more of the life we were created to live. This is progressive sanctification: the ongoing process of becoming who we truly are in Christ.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>See Repenting of Religion, pp. 89-112</i>"

Every day, the Holy Spirit is working to make us more aware of who we really are: beloved children of God, temples of the Most High, carriers of resurrection life. As this identity sinks deeper into our hearts, the old patterns of thinking and behaving naturally lose their grip. We don't become holy by effort but by revelation. The more we understand how completely we're loved, the more we naturally want to live in ways that reflect that love. This is sanctification: not becoming someone we're not, but becoming more fully who we already are in Christ."

Every time we pray, we're advancing the kingdom and pushing back the darkness. Every time we minister to the broken, we're plundering Satan's house and liberating his captives. This isn't optional ministry for super-spiritual Christians; it's the normal Christian life. We're not trying to win a battle that's already been lost—we're implementing a victory that's already been won. Prayer changes things because we're partnering with the God who has all authority in heaven and on earth. Ministry transforms lives because we're carrying the same Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>\"Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do\" (John 14:12)</i>"

The church is called to continue this same ministry. We cast out demons not because we're weird but because demonic oppression is real and Christ has given us authority over it. We pray for healing not because we're naive about medicine but because sickness is an enemy that Christ came to defeat. We fight for justice not because we're political activists but because systemic oppression is spiritual warfare on a societal level. Every act of love is an act of war against the kingdom of darkness.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>See God at War, pp. 235-267</i>"

We've been taught to accept suffering as God's will instead of recognizing it as Satan's attack. But Jesus never taught resignation—he taught resistance. When he encountered evil, he didn't say 'Father, thank you for this learning opportunity.' He said 'Get behind me, Satan!' The early church expected to see miracles, expected to cast out demons, expected to change the world. We've become so sophisticated that we've explained away our power. It's time to recover the expectation that God wants to work through us to push back the darkness and bring his kingdom to earth.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>See The Myth of a Christian Nation, pp. 134-156</i>"

Every time we choose love over hate, truth over lies, hope over despair, we're expanding the kingdom. Every time we create beauty, pursue justice, offer healing, we're demonstrating what the world looks like when God is in charge. We're not perfect, but we're being perfected. We're not there yet, but we're on the way. And every step forward is a victory for the kingdom of light over the kingdom of darkness."

We're not desperate; we're assured. We're not anxious; we're expectant. We know that every prayer is backed by all authority in heaven and on earth.

One day, there will be no more cancer, no more hurricanes, no more extinction of species. The lion will lie down with the lamb not just metaphorically but literally. This is our hope: not escape from the material world but its complete transformation.

This is breathtaking in its scope: every broken relationship healed, every injustice corrected, every tear wiped away. Evil will not have the last word in any corner of God's creation. The story ends not with some people going to heaven while everything else burns, but with heaven coming to earth and making all things new. This is the ultimate victory of love over hate, life over death, light over darkness.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>\"And he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ, to be put into effect when the times reach their fulfillment—to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ\" (Ephesians 1:9-10)</i>"
