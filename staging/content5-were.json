        "detail": "<br/>\nBabylon was ultimately conquered by the Medes and Persians, an event that occurred on October 12, 539 BC, the same night King Belshazzar was slain. Following this conquest, Darius the Mede received the kingdom at approximately sixty-two years of age. The Medo-Persian army, led by Cyrus the Great, had besieged Babylon and successfully took control of the city. This transition was a direct fulfillment of prophetic announcements, as Daniel had foretold Babylon's capture and its transfer to the Medes and Persians. In the book of Revelation, the drying up of the Euphrates (Revelation 16:12) is described as preparing the way for \"the kings of the east,\" symbolizing the forces that would facilitate the fall of spiritual Babylon, drawing parallels to this historical conquest."

        "detail": "<br/>\nHistorical accounts, including those by Herodotus and detailed in Xenophon's \"Cyropoedia,\" describe how Cyrus the Great ingeniously diverted the Euphrates River to conquer ancient Babylon. Rollins' Ancient History noted that Babylon was considered impregnable due to the Euphrates. Cyrus's forces achieved this by digging immense trenches and canals to turn the river out of its main channel, causing the water level within the city to drop significantly. This strategic maneuver made the riverbed \"passable for men,\" allowing Persian soldiers to infiltrate the city by surprise through the lowered river channel, entering under the city walls and through inner gates that were carelessly left open. While Herodotus' specific narrative of entering under the gates via the channel is cited, some modern interpretations suggest the fall might have been a more complex event."

        "detail": "<br/>\nThe fall of ancient Babylon occurred dramatically on a night characterized by King Belshazzar's great feast and widespread revelry. Belshazzar held a \"great feast for a thousand of his nobles\" where he and his guests were engaged in continuous and excessive drinking, likely leading to inebriation and a \"drunken orgy\". This massive party was held despite the Medo-Persian army already besieging the city, perhaps as an act of bravado or to boost morale. During this feast, in an act of profound sacrilege and open defiance against the God of Israel, Belshazzar ordered the sacred gold and silver vessels taken from the temple in Jerusalem to be used for drinking wine and praising the pagan gods of Babylon. It was in the midst of this blasphemous celebration that the mysterious fingers of a man's hand suddenly appeared, writing a message of doom on the palace wall, signaling the city's imminent fall."

        "detail": "<br/>\nIn Old Testament prophecy, the symbol of overflowing waters, particularly from the Euphrates, was often used to represent invasions by hostile enemy forces, frequently depicted as coming from the north into Israel. Even if armies originated from the east, the desert terrain often compelled them to travel northward along the Euphrates before descending into Israel. In Revelation 9:14, the \"loosing of the four angels... at the great river Euphrates\" similarly symbolizes a hostile invading power, fulfilled by the Turks overrunning the Eastern Roman Empire. Concerning the conquest of Babylon, the prophet Isaiah specifically referred to Cyrus, the Medo-Persian conqueror, as being raised up \"from the east\" and likened him to \"a bird of prey from the east,\" emphasizing the swiftness of his approach from distant regions. Although Cyrus's native province of Anshan was directly east of Babylon, his combined forces of Persians and Medes for the invasion ultimately approached from the north."

Prophets such as Isaiah and Jeremiah had long foretold Babylon's inevitable downfall, citing its pride, idolatry, and oppression of the Israelites, emphasizing that no nation opposing God would escape judgment. The handwriting on the wall, interpreted by Daniel, explicitly declared that God had \"numbered your kingdom and put an end to it\" and that it would be \"divided and given over to the Medes and Persians\". This was a clear divine pronouncement of imminent judgment, which God swiftly executed that very night. Isaiah even described Cyrus as God's \"shepherd\" and \"anointed,\" destined to perform God's \"pleasure,\" including subduing nations and commanding the rebuilding of Jerusalem and its temple. Cyrus's actions were thus seen as the fulfillment of God's predetermined will."

        "detail": "<br/>\nBabylon, both ancient and its spiritual counterpart in Revelation, faces divine judgment for its extensive sins. Revelation 14:8 describes \"Babylon the great\" as having made \"all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication,\" indicating its pervasive corrupting influence. The seven last plagues are specifically directed at Babylon as a consequence of her iniquity. Spiritual Babylon is revealed to be composed of three parts: the dragon (political powers allied with the Papacy), the beast (the Papacy itself), and the false prophet (apostate Protestantism), along with their global supporters. Just as God oversaw the destruction of ancient Babylon once its \"cup of iniquity\" was full, so too will the symbolic \"waters\"—representing the peoples and nations supporting spiritual Babylon—be \"dried up,\" signifying the withdrawal of their allegiance. This will lead to a dramatic reversal where the \"ten horns\" (representing supporting powers) will turn against the \"whore\" (Babylon) and destroy her, ensuring her complete downfall."

        "detail": "<br/>\nThe biblical accounts concerning Babylon, particularly in the book of Daniel, served as a profound message of hope and encouragement to God's people during their captivity. The very purpose of Daniel's prophecies was to reassure the nation of Judah in exile that God was in sovereign control of all world events and would ultimately bring about the promised Messianic Kingdom. The dramatic overthrow of the powerful Babylonian Empire by the Medes and Persians demonstrated that God could indeed bring down even the mightiest nations, offering solace to the \"fearful Israelites\". This historical event directly led to the end of the Babylonian Captivity, allowing the Israelites to return to Jerusalem and rebuild their Temple. Daniel himself, by maintaining his faith and integrity while enslaved in Babylon and refusing to compromise his devotion to God, stands as an exemplary role model for believers on how to live faithfully in a godless society."

        "detail": "<br/>\nThe Old Testament prophets Jeremiah and Isaiah vividly described the utter ruin and desolation of ancient Babylon, predicting its conquest by an enemy from the north. Jeremiah foretold a \"drought upon her waters\" and that her \"sea\" and \"springs\" would be \"dried up\" (Jeremiah 50:38; 51:36), while Isaiah proclaimed, \"Be dry and I will dry up thy rivers\" (Isaiah 44:27). These prophecies found literal fulfillment in Cyrus's conquest, which involved the strategic drying of the Euphrates River, a source of Babylon's glory and protection. In the book of Revelation, these detailed Old Testament accounts serve as a foreshadowing of the catastrophic end of spiritual Babylon in the end times. The seven last plagues, especially the sixth and seventh, depict its downfall through the symbolic \"drying up of the Euphrates,\" which represents the withdrawal of global support from its religious leaders. This culminates in internal strife, with its supporters turning on each other, leading to \"worldwide destruction, worldwide bloodshed\". Revelation 18:21 unequivocally declares Babylon the great city will be \"thrown down with violence, and will be found no more,\" signifying its absolute and final eradication."

        "detail": "<br/>\nThe paramount crime of Babylon, both historically and prophetically, is its deep-seated idolatry and outright defiance of the true God. In ancient Babylon, King Belshazzar epitomized this by blasphemously using the sacred vessels from the Jerusalem Temple to drink wine and praise pagan deities, an act condemned as the \"height of desecration\" and open contempt for God. This established Babylon's identity as a power exalting itself and its false gods above the Most High. In the context of spiritual Babylon in the last days, its gravest offense involves the deceptive \"doctrine or philosophy\" propagated by its religious leaders and clergy. These \"false shepherds\" manipulate their followers, leading them away from God's truth and even inciting them to attack God's loyal people. The exposure of Babylon's \"true character\" during the plagues causes its deluded supporters to recognize they have been \"robbed... of eternal life,\" leading to furious retribution against these unfaithful leaders, fulfilling the prophecy that \"the work of destruction begins among those who have professed to be the spiritual guardians of the people. The false watchman are first to fall\"."

        "detail": "<br/>\nThe narrative surrounding Babylon serves as a grave warning and an implicit plea for individuals to flee its \"sin-filled ways\" and avoid its ultimate judgment. Spiritual Babylon's \"deceptive power\" and \"doctrine or philosophy\" intoxicates its supporters, leading them to oppose God's people. The symbolic \"drying up of the Euphrates\" represents the exposure of Babylon's true, deceitful nature, resulting in a \"terrible awakening\" for its followers who realize they have been \"deluded\" and \"robbed... of eternal life\" by their religious leaders. This realization leads to immense remorse, confession, and even violent reactions against their former guides. The text strongly encourages choosing righteousness and being faithful to God's commandments. It emphasizes that God's people are \"called out of the world to be a people holy (or set apart, consecrated) to the Lord\" (Deuteronomy 7:6), urging them not to conform to a culture that embraces moral relativism and idolatry but instead to adhere to what is \"right in God's eyes\"."

        "detail": "<br/>\nThe \"drying up of the Euphrates\" in Revelation symbolizes the removal of support from spiritual Babylon, acting as God's decisive intervention against its attempts to destroy His loyal people. This event facilitates the deliverance and preservation of the saints during the time of the plagues. While not explicitly stated as a direct command to \"flee\" within these sources, the symbolic drying up of the waters and the subsequent internal collapse of Babylon create the conditions for God's people to be saved from its destructive influence. The broader context of Revelation points to a divine imperative for God's faithful to separate themselves from spiritual Babylon's corrupting influence to avoid sharing in its sins and receiving its impending plagues. Ultimately, Jesus Christ is depicted as delivering \"spiritual Israel from spiritual Babylon\" (Revelation 18:4, 8), which implies a necessary withdrawal or \"coming out\" from its midst to escape its final destruction."

This designation underscored his special role as an agent of God's will. He was also called God's \"shepherd,\" tasked with fulfilling God's \"pleasure\" by commanding the rebuilding of Jerusalem and its temple. Cyrus's divinely appointed mission was to conquer Babylon, subdue nations, and most significantly, to facilitate the liberation of literal Israel from Babylonian captivity. His subsequent decree allowing the Jewish people to return to their homeland and rebuild the temple was a direct fulfillment of God's command. Cyrus's actions in freeing God's people and restoring them to their land establish him as a significant \"type,\" or symbol, of Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate \"Anointed\" Deliverer of His spiritual people."

The book of Daniel provides an eyewitness account of this historic night, confirming that Babylon fell and King Belshazzar was slain, with Darius the Mede then receiving the kingdom. Cyrus's strategic brilliance in diverting the Euphrates River was instrumental in his forces gaining entry into the seemingly impregnable city. Notably, the prophet Daniel had foretold Babylon's fall to the Medes and Persians, and his influence even played a role in Cyrus's subsequent decree to allow the Jewish exiles to return to their homeland. Cyrus's army comprised both Persians and Medes, reflecting his dual heritage."
