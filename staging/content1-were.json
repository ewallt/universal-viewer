        "detail": "<br/>\nIn the Book of Revelation, ancient Babylon is explicitly employed as a \"type or picture\" of modern Babylon. This means that the historical characteristics and downfall of the literal city serve as a model for understanding the symbolic \"Babylon the great\" of the end times. The Holy Spirit inspired the apostle John to draw many expressions and descriptions from the Old Testament concerning ancient Babylon and apply them to its end-time counterpart, underscoring fundamental parallels between the two. This approach is crucial for understanding the prophetic significance of \"spiritual Babylon\" in Revelation. For instance, just as ancient Babylon gained control of the then-known world, spiritual Babylon is prophesied to dominate the entire world in the last days."

        "detail": "<br/>\nThe Euphrates mentioned in Revelation 16, particularly in the sixth plague, is not a literal river but a symbolic one, intrinsically connected with \"modern Babylon in the last days\". While the literal Euphrates flows through parts of modern-day Turkey, Syria, and Iraq, interpretations of this river as representing a specific country or religion have been discarded as lacking sound scriptural support. Instead, scripture itself reveals the symbolic meaning: the \"waters\" upon which spiritual Babylon sits are explicitly defined as \"peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues\". Therefore, the symbolic Euphrates represents the global human support—the millions of people worldwide—that sustains spiritual Babylon, making it her \"glory and protection\"."

        "detail": "<br/>\nHistorically, some Bible students held the view that a literal river in prophecy represented the country through which it flowed. Based on this principle, the Euphrates was once interpreted as symbolizing the Ottoman Empire, since the river flowed through its territory. However, this interpretation has been discarded because the Ottoman Empire has since vanished, making this specific application no longer valid. This demonstrates the need for a more enduring and scripturally supported interpretation of the Euphrates in Revelation."

        "detail": "<br/>\nThe view that the Euphrates represents a literal religion, such as Islam, is also based on the discarded principle that a river symbolizes the country it flows through, and it lacks sound scriptural support. The sources emphasize that there is no hint in scripture that a river represents a religion. Instead, scripture provides a distinct, symbolic interpretation for the \"waters\" of the Euphrates. Revelation 17:15 explicitly identifies these \"waters\" as \"peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues,\" indicating that the Euphrates symbolizes the widespread human support for spiritual Babylon, rather than a specific religious system. This scriptural definition guides the understanding of the Euphrates as a symbol of global allegiance to modern Babylon."

        "detail": "<br/>\nThe sources emphatically state that scripture does provide a different and clear conclusion regarding the meaning of the Euphrates in Revelation, contrary to speculative interpretations linking it to countries or literal religions. When the Bible is allowed to interpret its own symbols, Revelation 17:15 directly reveals that the \"waters\" on which the \"great whore\" (Babylon) sits \"are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues\". This definitively establishes the symbolic nature of the Euphrates as representing the vast global human support that underpins spiritual Babylon, rather than a geographical entity or religious group."

The drying up of these waters signifies the withdrawal of this widespread global human support, leading to Babylon's downfall."

Furthermore, \"all that dwell upon the earth\" whose names are \"not written in the book of life\" will ultimately support Babylon. This coalition of political powers (the dragon), the Papacy (the beast), and apostate Protestantism (the false prophet), along with their vast network of supporters, forms the comprehensive \"tremendous organization and power that is rising in our midst,\" which constitutes spiritual Babylon's \"glory and protection\"."

        "detail": "<br/>\nIn its original language, the word \"Euphrates\" means \"to break forth, to rush, rushing\". This term historically reflected the river's tendency for sudden flooding caused by the melting snows in the mountains of Armenia, its source. These overflows would spread across the land, particularly in the northern regions of Israel, which bordered the Euphrates. This characteristic of the literal river, its powerful and overwhelming rush, provides a literal basis for its symbolic use in biblical prophecy."

        "detail": "<br/>\nThe Old Testament prophets frequently employed the overflowing of the Euphrates to represent an invasion by enemy forces, typically from the north, into the land of Israel. For example, Jeremiah 47:2 speaks of \"waters rise up out of the north and shall be an overflowing flood and overflow the land,\" symbolizing a hostile incursion. Isaiah 8:7-8 similarly likens the Assyrian King Sennacherib's invasion to \"the waters of the river, strong and many,\" coming up over \"all his channels\". This established a prophetic precedent where the \"flood\" or \"rushing of many waters\" symbolized a powerful, hostile attack."

        "detail": "<br/>\nBuilding on the Old Testament symbolism, the Euphrates in Revelation 16, particularly in the sixth plague, retains the connotation of an invasion or an attack. Just as literal Babylon attacked literal Israel in ancient times, the \"symbolic Euphrates\" in the end times represents an attack by spiritual Babylon upon spiritual Israel, \"the church of God\". Revelation 17:2 indicates that \"Babylon’s supporters will be deluded, or intoxicated by Babylon’s doctrine or philosophy, and as a result they will be manipulated and used to attack God’s people\". This \"invasion by hostile people, like a mighty flood, against the church of God\" is what the term \"Euphrates\" symbolizes in the context of the final conflict."

This imagery is a direct parallel to Jeremiah 51:13, which describes ancient Babylon as dwelling \"on many waters\" – referring to the literal Euphrates and its canals. In Revelation, the context immediately signals that these \"waters\" are symbolic, signifying Babylon's widespread influence and support."

Revelation 17:15 explicitly states, \"The waters which thou saw where the whore sits are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.\" This passage unequivocally clarifies that the symbolic Euphrates, or \"many waters,\" represents the vast global population that lends its support and allegiance to spiritual Babylon. This includes \"multitudes of people around the globe\" who will ultimately \"give their allegiance to Babylon,\" serving as her \"glory and protection\" in the end times."
