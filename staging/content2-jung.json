        "detail": "Archetypes are the fundamental, original patterns or images that exist as inherited psychic structures within the collective unconscious. Jung described them as 'primordial' because they represent the most ancient and universal forms of human experience - patterns that have emerged from countless generations of human encounters with life's essential situations. These are not learned or acquired through personal experience, but rather represent the basic templates through which we unconsciously organize and interpret our experiences. They are like psychological blueprints that shape how we perceive and respond to archetypal situations such as the relationship with parents (Great Mother archetype), the encounter with our hidden aspects (Shadow archetype), or the journey toward wholeness (Hero's journey). These primordial images emerge spontaneously in dreams, myths, and fantasies across all cultures, suggesting their universal and inherited nature."
