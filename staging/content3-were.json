        "detail": "<br/>\nThe Euphrates River is a significant geographical feature that originates in the mountains of Armenia, flows south through Syria, then southeast through Iraq, and finally empties into the Persian Gulf. In the book of Revelation, the Euphrates is mentioned in two predictions: the sixth trumpet of Revelation 9 and specifically the sixth plague in Revelation 16. The Bible reveals that the Euphrates is the river of ancient Babylon. Since ancient Babylon is depicted in Revelation as a \"type or picture\" of modern Babylon, the Euphrates itself is understood to be a symbolic river connected with modern Babylon in the last days. Just as ancient Babylon was situated on the literal Euphrates and its many canals, so spiritual Babylon is pictured as dwelling on \"many waters\"."

        "detail": "<br/>\nThe interpretation of the Euphrates in Revelation has evolved. A view once held by some Bible students was that a river represents the country through which it flows. Based on this, when the Euphrates flowed through the Ottoman Empire, it was declared to represent that empire. However, since the Ottoman Empire has vanished, this application is no longer valid. Similarly, the idea that the Euphrates represents the Islamic religion, often based on the river flowing through Islamic countries, stems from this now-discarded principle. The sources state there is no sound scriptural support for a river representing a country or a religion, nor is there any hint in scripture that a river represents a religion. Therefore, when scripture is allowed to answer what the Euphrates is, a different conclusion must be drawn, indicating its symbolic nature."

        "detail": "<br/>\nIn its original language, the word \"Euphrates\" means \"to break forth, to rush, rushing\". This term was historically applied to the Euphrates River because the melting snow from the Armenian mountains would cause sudden floods, leading the waters to overflow their banks and spread across the land. Historically, the Euphrates served as the northern boundary of Israel. Old Testament prophets employed the overflowing of the Euphrates to symbolize an invasion by enemy forces from the north into the land of Israel. For example, Jeremiah 47:2 describes waters rising from the north as an \"overflowing flood\", and Isaiah 8:7-8 likens the Assyrian King Sennacherib's invasion to the overflowing of the river's strong and many waters. The term \"flood\" itself is also used in scripture to represent an invasion or attack by hostile powers. In the book of Revelation, the term \"Euphrates\" carries a similar connotation, representing an invasion or attack by Babylon upon God's remnant people."

Revelation 17:15 explicitly explains that \"the waters which thou saw where the whore sits are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues\". This means that the \"numerous peoples all over the world\" who support the \"great religious apostasy\" comprise the waters upon which modern Babylon sits. Just as the literal Euphrates river was the \"glory and protection\" of ancient Babylon, making it seem impregnable, so the millions of people globally who support modern Babylon will be its \"glory and protection\". This support includes nations, rulers, merchants, financiers, and multinational entities. This symbolic drying up of the Euphrates in the end time leads to the collapse of Babylon because it represents the withdrawal of this worldwide civil, secular, and political support."

The Euphrates is also mentioned in the sixth trumpet of Revelation 9:14, where it describes the loosing of four angels, representing an invading hostile power that would overrun the Eastern Roman Empire. The sixth plague is described in symbolic language, drawing from ancient Babylon, which is consistently symbolic in Revelation. The passage describes how the sixth angel pours his bowl upon the Euphrates, causing its water to dry up to prepare the way for the \"kings of the east\". This event is intrinsically linked to the \"tremendous climax between good and evil\"."

Just as King Cyrus conquered ancient Babylon by diverting the literal Euphrates river, allowing his forces to enter the city, the symbolic drying up represents God turning away the worldwide support from modern Babylon. This event, described also as the \"ten horns\" turning against and destroying the \"whore\" (Babylon), is the removal of the \"support of the peoples all over the world from the great apostate religious system\". This withdrawal of support leads to Babylon's downfall. It is also interpreted as the millions of people who initially supported spiritual Babylon eventually turning away and against its religious leaders."

While many scholars acknowledge Revelation 16:15 as a parenthetical warning that interrupts the text's flow, omitting it demonstrates the unity of the rest of the section. This section is divided into three subparts: 1. Preparation for battle (Revelation 16:12-14), which includes the drying up of the Euphrates (v. 12) and the sending out of three frog-like unclean spirits (v. 13), followed by an explanation of these spirits (v. 14). 2. Jesus' warning and beatitude (Revelation 16:15). 3. Gathering for battle (Revelation 16:16) at the place called Armageddon. This tripartite structure is considered analogous to the structures found in the sixth seal and sixth trumpet, suggesting a parallel, rather than sequential, understanding of these sections in the Apocalypse."

Babylon is described as \"the most deceptive power ever known,\" making her exposure essential for all to see. This exposure culminates in the fifth plague, the plague of darkness, which falls upon \"the seat [throne] of the beast and his kingdom was full of darkness\". During this time, God's people are on the verge of destruction, with human laws withdrawn and a simultaneous movement for their eradication. God intervenes at this \"hour of utmost extremity\". A \"dense blackness\" falls upon the earth (the fifth plague), followed by a rainbow from God's throne encircling each praying company. This intervention shocks Babylon's supporters, revealing that God protects the remnant. God's judgment is often expressed through what the sources call His \"passive anger,\" where He allows people to experience the consequences of their sin, and \"active anger,\" where He directly disciplines them. This divine intervention is crucial because God allows Babylon to attain universal dominion to reveal her true character, ensuring that when Christ destroys her, there will be no doubt about God's justice."

These millions, previously convinced that Babylon was right and the dissenting remnant was wrong, are confronted with shattering evidence that God protects the remnant. In the \"fifth plague of extreme blackness,\" a \"blinding rainbow\" envelops the praying saints, suddenly shocking Babylon's supporters into realizing that these despised people are God's chosen. This event signifies the diversion of the \"many waters\" and the removal of the people's support from Babylon. As their eyes are opened, the multitude realizes they have been deluded by their religious leaders. The \"unfaithful clergy\" confess their deceptions, admitting that the persecuted ones are God's true people, and \"cringe at the feet of the saints\". Following this confession, the multitudes react with \"frightful violence,\" turning upon their ministers with \"bitter hate,\" accusing them of deception, and destroying them with their own hands. This destruction, which begins among the \"false watchman,\" leads to widespread strife and bloodshed, with Babylon's supporters eventually turning upon each other in \"fearful frustration and devastating disappointment\"."

Revelation 18:3 states that \"all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies,\" indicating that the \"world at large will support Babylon\". Modern Babylon is described as glorifying herself and living luxuriously, declaring, \"I sit a queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow,\" mirroring ancient Babylon's aim to rule forever. This \"apostate religious system\" will be led by the Papacy."

The \"beast\", which Revelation 13:1-10 shows to be the Papacy. 3. The \"false prophet\", which represents \"apostate Protestantism\". These three main sections form \"spiritual Babylon\" that will lead the world against God in the last days. Additionally, their supporters also form part of Babylon, with \"all the world\" wondering after the beast, meaning all who are not faithful to Christ will ultimately support Babylon."

Babylon is condemned for its \"sorcery\" by which \"all the nations were deceived\" and for having \"the blood of prophets and saints\" found in her. God permits Satan to establish his kingdom, Babylon the Great, and allows it to achieve universal dominion so that its true deceptive character is revealed to the world and the universe.

This term is highly symbolic in Scripture and is used in connection with Jesus Christ. For instance, Jesus is referred to as the \"Dayspring\" or \"Sunrising\" (from the Greek) in the song of Zacharias, and as the \"Sun of Righteousness\" by the prophet Malachi. Just as the sun rises from the east, shedding light and life, so Jesus, the spiritual sun, brings spiritual light and life. When Christ returns at the Second Advent, He comes from the east, with His glory appearing on the eastern horizon and enveloping the globe, likened to lightning coming from the east and flashing to the west. Historically, Cyrus, who is seen as a type of Christ, also came from the east to conquer Babylon. The kings from the sunrising represent Christ and the armies of heaven, including the Lamb and the saints, who are on God's side in the great controversy."

The act of the Euphrates drying up symbolizes the withdrawal of support from Babylon by these civil, secular, and political powers, ultimately leading to its downfall. The sixth plague, which involves the drying of the Euphrates, is couched in symbolic language due to Babylon's symbolic nature in Revelation."

Revelation, also known as the Apocalypse of John, is recognized by scholars for its complex prophetic and symbolic nature, often posing problems for interpretation due to its literary structure. Some interpretations view the book as describing past events, suggesting it is not a prediction of the future, while others strongly affirm its prophetic character regarding future events and the second coming of Christ. Notably, Louis Fitzroy Were, a Seventh-day Adventist minister and author, developed thirteen principles of Bible interpretation, including the concept of \"double\" and \"triple\" applications of prophecy and the idea that \"the things of Israel now belong to the church,\" meaning Old Testament prophecies are reinterpreted in the context of the New Testament church. He contended that what was portrayed locally in the Old Testament is reinterpreted universally in Revelation. The prophecies concerning Babylon's downfall due to pride, idolatry, and oppression were fulfilled historically and serve as a \"sure and certain\" prophetic pattern for end-time events."

According to ancient historians like Herodotus and Xenophon, Cyrus's forces ingeniously diverted the Euphrates River, which flowed under the city walls and through Babylon. By digging ditches and turning the river aside, the water level dropped, enabling Persian soldiers to enter the city through the riverbed by surprise. This allowed them to infiltrate the city, kill the guards, and take over without a major battle. Belshazzar was slain that very night."

Specifically, prophecies stated that a \"drought\" would be upon her waters, and they would be \"dried up\" (Jeremiah 50:38; 51:36; Isaiah 44:27). These predictions were \"abundantly fulfilled\" by King Cyrus and his Medes and Persians. The sources emphasize that God always opposes human arrogance and deals severely with those who blaspheme Him, ensuring that no nation \"so set against God escapes judgment\". God's anger at Israel's idolatry, which led to their delivery into Babylonian oppression, is rooted in His \"unfailing love\" and commitment to His people's good."

The book of Daniel, written to the nation of Judah during this captivity, aimed to encourage them about God's future prophetic program and exhort them to live faithfully. The fall of Babylon in 539 BC, led by Cyrus the Great, marked the end of the Babylonian Captivity, allowing the Israelites to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple.
