If God predetermined everything that would happen, then our prayers, our choices, and our love would all be scripted performances in a cosmic play. But the God revealed in Scripture is far more wonderful than that—he's a God who takes real risks for real relationship. When we pray, we're not reciting lines he wrote for us; we're actually influencing the course of history. When we choose to love, we're not fulfilling a predetermined role; we're genuinely surprising and delighting the heart of God. This makes every moment precious, every choice significant, every relationship authentic.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>See God of the Possible, pp. 18-45</i>"

But the God of Scripture laughs, grieves, gets angry, changes his mind, and experiences surprise. This isn't a limitation—it's the glory of a God who cares so much that he allows himself to be affected by his creation. When our hearts break, his heart breaks with us. When we rejoice, he rejoices over us with singing. This divine responsiveness doesn't make God weak; it makes him magnificent. Only a God who is infinitely secure in his own nature can afford to be vulnerable enough for genuine relationship. This is love that risks everything because it considers the beloved worth everything.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>\"The Lord your God is in your midst, a mighty one who will save; he will rejoice over you with gladness; he will quiet you by his love; he will exult over you with loud singing\" (Zephaniah 3:17)</i>"

But in the open view, the battles are real because the outcomes are genuinely uncertain. When we pray for someone's salvation, we're not just going through the motions—we're actually influencing whether they'll be saved. When we resist temptation, we're not fulfilling a predetermined script—we're genuinely choosing good over evil. This makes spiritual warfare thrilling rather than fatalistic. Every prayer matters because it might tip the balance. Every act of love counts because it might be the one that breaks through someone's defenses. We're not passive observers of God's plan—we're active participants in God's mission.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>See Is God to Blame?, pp. 78-103</i>"

This is the God we serve: not a cosmic puppeteer pulling strings, but a master strategist so brilliant that he can turn even the enemy's victories into stepping stones toward his ultimate triumph. No matter what Satan throws at him, God always has a response that advances the kingdom.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>See The Crucifixion of the Warrior God, Volume 1, pp. 267-274</i>"

When a child dies of cancer, we don't have to torture ourselves trying to figure out what divine purpose it serves. We can grieve with those who grieve, rage against the disease, and fight it with everything we have, knowing that God is grieving and raging and fighting right alongside us. This is profoundly pastoral because it allows people to be honest about their pain without feeling like they're questioning God's goodness. Evil is real, it's terrible, and God hates it even more than we do. That's not a theological problem—it's a theological comfort.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>See Present Perfect, pp. 89-134</i>"

But when we understand that evil comes from God's enemies, not from God himself, the logical response is active resistance. This transforms the entire Christian life from waiting for God to fix things to partnering with God to fight things. Instead of saying 'God's will be done' when we encounter evil, we start saying 'God's kingdom come' and then doing something to advance it. This isn't presumption—it's obedience. Jesus told us to pray 'Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.' That's not a prayer for passive acceptance; it's a prayer for active transformation.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>See The Myth of a Christian Religion, pp. 67-89</i>"

The traditional answer—that it's all part of his mysterious plan—makes God sound like a cosmic sadist. But the warfare worldview provides a coherent alternative: evil exists not because God wills it but because God's enemies will it. God allows it not because he wants it but because love requires freedom, and freedom makes rebellion possible. This preserves both God's goodness (he opposes all evil) and his power (he will ultimately defeat all evil). It's not a complete answer to every question, but it's an answer that allows honest people to maintain both their intellectual integrity and their faith in God's character.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>See Benefit of the Doubt, pp. 145-178</i>"

                "detail": "\n<br/>\nWhen we understand that we're living in a war zone, it changes how we interpret the casualties. A soldier wounded in battle isn't being punished by his commanding officer—he's a victim of enemy fire. Similarly, when believers suffer, it's usually not because God is disciplining them but because they're caught in the crossfire of a cosmic conflict. This framework brings tremendous comfort to people who have been tormented by the question 'What did I do to deserve this?' The answer is often 'Nothing. You're just living in a world at war, and sometimes good people get hurt.' This doesn't minimize the pain, but it relocates the blame where it belongs—on the enemy, not on God."

Instead of either rejecting difficult passages or defending divine violence, we can now see these texts as God bearing the appearance of human sinfulness in order to ultimately reveal his true character. This isn't liberal theology that explains away inconvenient verses—it's evangelical theology that takes seriously both the inspiration of Scripture and the revelation of God in Christ. The Bible is fully inspired and fully truthful when it shows us a God willing to let us misunderstand him temporarily in order to reveal himself truly.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>See Cross Vision, pp. 15-43</i>"

The cruciform hermeneutic acknowledges that biblical authors were real people writing in real historical contexts, influenced by their cultures and limited by their perspectives. But it also insists that God was working through this process to reveal himself progressively, culminating in the perfect revelation of his character in Christ. This means we can appreciate the human dimension of Scripture without losing its divine authority. We can acknowledge cultural conditioning without abandoning biblical truth. The key is reading everything through the lens of the cross, which separates what is eternally true about God from what is temporarily accommodated to human understanding."

Every Old Testament 'holy war' becomes a preview of the ultimate holy war where God would defeat evil through suffering rather than inflicting it. Every divine judgment becomes a foreshadowing of the final judgment where God would absorb the consequences of sin rather than pour out punishment. This isn't reading foreign meanings into the text—it's discovering the meaning that was always there, waiting to be unveiled when the full revelation came in Christ. The cross doesn't contradict these passages; it completes them by showing us what they were always pointing toward.\n<br/><br/>\n<i>See The Crucifixion of the Warrior God, Volume 2, pp. 1247-1289</i>"

When we read about God commanding violence, we have to ask: does this look like the God we see in Jesus? If not, then we're probably seeing cultural accommodation rather than eternal revelation. This isn't picking and choosing what we like—it's using the clearest revelation to interpret the less clear ones. Jesus himself used this principle when he said 'You have heard it said... but I say to you.' He wasn't rejecting Scripture; he was revealing its true meaning by showing us what God is really like. The cross is our interpretive key because it's God's final, definitive, and perfect self-revelation."

When we read it as story rather than just doctrine, it comes alive in ways that transform not just our thinking but our imaginations. We discover that we're not just students of theology but characters in an ongoing drama. The same God who parted the Red Sea and raised Jesus from the dead is writing our chapter right now.

When we turn Christianity into a system of abstract propositions, we lose the personal, relational, dynamic quality that makes it so compelling. The gospel isn't primarily a set of facts to believe but a story to enter. It's not just information about God but an invitation to participate in God's life. This doesn't mean we abandon careful thinking—it means we think carefully about a God who is fundamentally personal rather than propositional. Systematic theology has its place, but it should serve the story, not replace it.

The God who defeated Pharaoh's magicians is the same God who defeated Satan at the cross. The victory songs of Israel anticipate the victory song of the Lamb.
