          "explanation": "The history of the Jewish nation serves as the primary case study. Their initial popularity with Christ, driven by miracles and prophecy, was ultimately overturned by their deeply ingrained, false expectations of a worldly Messiah—a misunderstanding rooted in a distorted view of God's character.",

          "explanation": "At the Sermon on the Mount, the people hoped for announcements of worldly greatness—dominion over Romans, riches, and national glory. This revealed their concept of God as a deity of power and force.
